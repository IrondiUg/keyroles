
# KeyRoles – C++ Role-Based Access Control System

**KeyRoles** is a robust C++ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system** designed for organizations with multiple departments and ranks. It ensures **secure, structured, and auditable access** for all users.  
---
## **Core Functionality**
- **🔒 Secure Login Authentication:** Users can only access the system with valid credentials.  
- **📊 Department-Specific Dashboards:** Each department has a customized interface tailored to its roles.  
- **🛡️ Rank-Based Permissions:** User actions are controlled based on their rank within the department.  
- **📝 Activity Logging:** Logs all user actions, including login, logout, session duration, and performed tasks.  

---

## **Key Features**
- **👥 Role-Based Access:** Each user’s permissions are determined by their department and rank, ensuring proper access control.  
- **🎛️ Custom Dashboards:** Personalized dashboards for each role provide relevant tools and information.  
- **⏰ Time-Based Login Restrictions:** Users can only log in during working hours (8 AM–4 PM) unless granted admin authorization.  
- **📌 Comprehensive Activity Tracking:** Every login, logout, and action is recorded for audit and accountability purposes.
